This project attempts to demonstrate some different development tools for programming in R. This project will include continuous integration using Travis CI, unit testing using testthat, and functional testing using shinytest.

## Continous Integration
CI is helpful for iterative software development. It lets you know your additions and changes to your repository will not break any other of your code. The badge at the top of this read me gives the status(hopefully passing).

## Unit Testing
Unit testing doesn't add much value to a project this small, the unit tests are practically functional.

## Functional Testing
Functional testing tests the end product and ensure all of the pieces are working together correctly. It tests the function of the overall application.
